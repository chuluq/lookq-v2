# Portfolio V2

## Overview

This is the 2nd and most recent version of my personal site which I am currently building with Next.js, and TailwindCSS.

This project is bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Running the project locally

- Clone the project locally

From the repo:

### `git clone`

- Installs dependencies required for the app to run in development mode.

On the command line or in the terminal of your preferred editor, you can run:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
```

- Fire up the development server by running:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
